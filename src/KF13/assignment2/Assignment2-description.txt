Assignment 2 description

    Modify SearchCmd so that if the user requests a search for a particular word (say, “Hans”), 
    the URLs of all pages where the word “Hans” occurs are written to the screen. 
    This has to be done by changing the search method in SearchCmd. 
    It is not done by changing the data structure.
