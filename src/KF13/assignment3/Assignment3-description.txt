Assignment 3 description

    Modify the construction of the data structure in such a way that a linked list of pairs 
    of strings and urls is created. This linked list consists of objects containing three fields. 
    The three fields are str, next and urls. The fields str and next are like in SearchCmd, but 
    we will now only use the str field to store words (i.e. not urls) and each word only occurs once. 
    In case an object contains the word “Hans” in the field str, the object’s urls field will be a 
    pointer to a list of URLs of all pages that contain the word “Hans”. A list of URLs consists of 
    objects with two fields; next and url.
    The field next is a pointer to the next object in the list and the field url is (a pointer to) a URL. 
    After construction of this data structure, you have to program the corresponding search procedure(s). 
    The data structure created in this assignment has smaller size than the structure from SearchCmd and is 
    faster to search through.
